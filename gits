GIT:

* 	git init 		>> to create offline repository.

* 	Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; 
	they can be unmodified, modified, or staged.
	When you first clone a repository, all of
	your files will be tracked and unmodified because you just checked them out
	and havenâ€™t edited anything.

*	git status		>> check repo status

* 	git add 		>> track new file

* 	(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

* 	git commit 		>> commit the changes to local repo

* 	git rm 			>> remove files from local repo

* 	git mv 			>> rename files

* 	git log 		>> commands history

* 	git log --since=2.weeks
	git log --since=1.seconds
	git log --since=1.minuts

*	git commit --amend	>> 	if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the
							changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit,
* 	git reset HEAD		>>  unstage files but not untrack
	git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md

*	git checkout		>>  reset before commit and back oldest same state,
							git checkout
							
	git branch -m <oldname> <newname> >> rename branch

*	git remote add url	>>  add remote repository 

* 	git fetch origi	>> to get data from your remote projects

* 	git push [remote-name]	[branch-name] 	>> push files to remote server and branch name
	git remote show origin
	git remote rename                       >> Removing and Renaming Remotes

* 	git tag "v1.0.0"			>> point in history to specific points  (( very useful becasue it save state of what 																			you have until now ))

* git config --global alias.[command name] 	[target command] 	>> alias the target to command name
